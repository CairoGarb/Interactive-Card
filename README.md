# Interactive Card Details

This is a challenge from Frontend Mentor website.
First time I used React + TypeScript.

# How It Works

There is a formulary with a few inputs. The value is stored and used in real time when typing, filling all the cards. The form has several validations to each input, when all is achieved, a variable checks if the form is valid or not, when the form is submitted(if is valid), a "Thank You" message appears. If the variable is not valid, the "Thank You" message do not appears.
